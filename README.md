# Portfolio
This is a React portfolio website built with Vite for fast performance. The app showcases projects, experience, and skills. It dynamically loads my experience, skills, and project data from JSON files so I can easily update data as needed. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages. The project uses some modern web development best practices like CSS modules for styling.
